## 1.0.1
**Bugs**
- `LEAP_TRACKING_EVENT` now calculates `LEAP_HAND`'s native size dynamically instead of relying on a constant.
- Fix Euler calculations in `LEAP_QUATERNION` and add unit tests for them.

**Other**
- Moved the 2D visualiser application into an example package and re-wrote most of the code.

## 1.0.0
**API changes**
- Bindings for all functionality in the Orion SDK v4.0.0+52173.

**Other**
- Added a simple graphical program for testing hand tracking and image reading (with extremely messy code; please don't look at it).
